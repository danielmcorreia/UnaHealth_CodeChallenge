# UnaHealth_CodeChallenge

This repository holds all necessary notebooks & data to run the solution for the code challenge proposed by Una Health.

# Files in this repository:
- Data (provided by Una Health);
- UnaHealth_Challend.ipynb

# Instructions:
The challenge solution can be run from the Jupyter Notebook UnaHealth_Challenge entirely; all visualisations/interactions, approaches used, conventions adopted and interpretations can be accessed and read here.


Please note the following information regarding the visualisations:

- Visualisation 1 (historic blood glucose levels by patient) includes a range slider to allow for quick visualisation of a restrict time period of interest in the time series; limit both upper and lower bonds of the slider with the mouse to limit the time period of interest.

- Visualisation 2 aims at allowing to observe the blood glucose levels immediately prior (up to -1h) and after (up until +3h) food intake, after each of the meals, and for each of the 3 subjects.
